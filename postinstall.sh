# postinstall.sh - Executed after all plugin files have been copied.
# Runs as user "loxberry" AFTER files are installed and BEFORE postupgrade.sh.
# Use this for post-copy tasks that do not require root, e.g. setting file
# permissions, writing initial config values, or enabling a cron job.
# Use with caution - remember that all target systems may differ.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = success, installation continues
#   1 = warning, installation continues but a warning is shown
#   2 = error, installation is cancelled
#
# All variables from /etc/environment are available in this script.
#
# Arguments passed to this script:
#   $0 = path to this script
#   $1 = temporary folder used during installation (short form)
#   $2 = plugin short name (NAME from plugin.cfg, used for scripts/cron)
#   $3 = plugin installation folder (FOLDER from plugin.cfg, may have 01/02 suffix)
#   $4 = plugin version (VERSION from plugin.cfg)
#   $5 = (unused, was LBHOMEDIR - now comes from /etc/environment)
#   $6 = full temporary path during installation
#
# Output tags for colorized installer log:
#   <OK>      green  - operation successful
#   <INFO>    blue   - informational message
#   <WARNING> yellow - non-fatal warning
#   <ERROR>   red    - error (combined with exit 2 to cancel)
#   <FAIL>    red    - failure
